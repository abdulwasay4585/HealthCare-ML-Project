1. Classification Model
Type: Ensemble Learning
Model Name: Random Forest Classifier (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
Hyperparameters: n_estimators=50, max_depth=10
Purpose: Used to predict the binary outcome of whether a patient will be readmitted (NO vs YES). Random Forests are excellent for this as they handle non-linear interactions between demographic and medical features well and are robust to overfitting.
2. Regression Model
Type: Linear Model with Regularization
Model Name: Ridge Regression (sklearn.linear_model.Ridge)
Hyperparameters: alpha=1.0 (Standard L2 regularization)
Purpose: Used to predict the continuous likelihood of the Length of Stay (number of days). Ridge regression is chosen to prevent overfitting (common in medical data with many correlated features) by penalizing large coefficients.
